In a loop:
Ask users what to do using input()

1.
Show members of opposite sex 10 years older ( Hint: you filter should take note of current member age and increment 
query result of those + 10 years of the age. sex of returned result should be the opposite sex. i.e if male is searching, return female sex)

2.
Ask user for desired member country location to chat. use provided input to update user country location and then return all opposite sex members in that location. 
ensure you filter underage members- 15 years below and your result should show only the first 5 - (i.e use fetchmany() and provide the size as 5)

3.
Exit the application for those whose age is between 10 - 15 years and print a warning message.
